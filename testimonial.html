            <p> My first time to create a webpage, is very exciting I got to learn about background, codes, 
             Then learn to edit and explore visual fox pro. How to manage it and learn to deal with it
             It is very helpful as an ALS implementer and be able to share this to my learners

        <t1> Challenges </t2>
            <p1> At first I have  problem with the codes but by running through and tracing where I commit mistake is very challenging 
             Second when getting my program live, I also encountered problems as some is not working
             In the end asking help with fellow implementers made the experience more enjoyable and memorable
